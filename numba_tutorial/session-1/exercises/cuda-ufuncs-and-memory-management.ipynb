    "  * **Our inputs are too small**: the GPU achieves performance through parallelism, operating on thousands of values at once.  Our test inputs have only 4 and 16 integers, respectively.  We need a much larger array to even keep the GPU busy.\n",
    "  * **Our calculation is too simple**: Sending a calculation to the GPU involves quite a bit of overhead compared to calling a function on the CPU.  If our calculation does not involve enough math operations (often called \"arithmetic intensity\"), then the GPU will spend most of its time waiting for data to move around.\n",
    "  * **We copy the data to and from the GPU**: While in some scenarios, paying the cost of copying data to and from the GPU can be worth it for a single function, often it will be preferred to to run several GPU operations in sequence. In those cases, it makes sense to send data to the GPU and keep it there until all of our processing is complete.\n",
    "  * **Our data types are larger than necessary**: Our example uses `int64` when we probably don't need it.  Scalar code using data types that are 32 and 64-bit run basically the same speed on the CPU, and for integer types the difference may not be drastic, but 64-bit floating point data types have a significant performance cost on the GPU.  Basic arithmetic on 64-bit floats can be anywhere from 2x (Pascal-architecture Tesla) to 24x (Maxwell-architecture GeForce) slower than 32-bit floats.  NumPy defaults to 64-bit data types when creating arrays, so it is important to set the [`dtype`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.14.0/reference/arrays.dtypes.html) attribute or use the [`ndarray.astype()`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.15.0/reference/generated/numpy.ndarray.astype.html) method to pick 32-bit types when you need them.\n",
